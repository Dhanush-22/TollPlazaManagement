# Toll Plaza Managemnet System using ANPR

This project aims to build an efficient toll collection system on highways by reading the license plate of vehicles (using AUTOMATIC NUMBER PLATE RECOGNITION) from the existing CCTV cameras at tolls and debiting the credits from the vehicle. It is a web application built using the Django framework and other web technologies. It contains a few client-side components of the existing fast tag application (like register, recharge, etc). This web application allows users to register their vehicles and recharge credits. 
Further, it can be improved by reading more vehicle number plates at a time using drone technology and image pre-processing techniques.
