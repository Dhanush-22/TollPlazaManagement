# Toll Plaza Management System using ANPR
#### using Django Framework
The project aims to build a web application for an efficient toll collection system on highways by reading the license plate (using AUTOMATIC NUMBER PLATE RECOGNITION) from the existing CCTV cameras at tolls and debiting the credits from a vehicle. This web application allows users to register their vehicles and recharge credits to cross tolls.
